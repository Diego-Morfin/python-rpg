# python-rpg

### Description
This is one of the first projects I ever wrote on python when I was first starting. It is a small text based game based on turned based combat (similar to pokemon). This project I wrote before I started my degree and it was meant to be a work in progress. It has a few options in the main menu, you can see your stats, start a battle, or customize a battle. This was written purely in Python and requires nothing to run.
